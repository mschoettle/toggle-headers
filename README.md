# Toggle Headers Thunderbird Extension

This extensions allows you to switch between the normal header view and viewing all headers when viewing a message by using a keyboard shortcut.
The shortcut is `Ctrl+H` (single key shortcuts are unfortunately not allowed anymore).
Prior to version 3 the shortcut is just `H`.

The extension is published at: https://addons.thunderbird.net/thunderbird/addon/toggle-headers/

**Acknowledgement:** The original idea for this extensions is taken from "Headers Toggle" by _Pontus Freyhult_ which unfortunately was not continued for current Thunderbird versions.
